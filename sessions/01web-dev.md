## HTML
***
- #### Hyper Text Markup Language
	- Hyper Text - text with sources that can be accessed through web
	- Markup - identifiers which helps to structure the document
	- Language - a combination of the above 2 such that, machine can understand it.
- #### HTML is responsible to structure the whole webpage using elements
	- Structuring covers the blueprint or main elements that are bare bone and needed in the page.
	- These elements are by default stacked after one another.
	- HTML elements are like different types of building blocks that we use to put together a webpage
	- Each element has a special job defined by the markup tag.
	- HTML parser is responsible to understand which tag is there and what it do for structuring the web page.
- #### HTML is rendered on the web in the form of tree
	- HTML parser parses the whole document in the form of tree data structure.
	- This HTML tree signifies the parent child relationship from the nested tags that are used in the document.
	- The tree data structure is chosen because it highly resembles with the type of code an html document is having i.e. nested elements.
	- Search operation for any particular element is also efficient if developer wants to hand pick and change them from the document.
