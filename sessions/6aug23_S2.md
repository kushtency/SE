## Terms :
- Single Responsibility principle
- Extensibility
- Transparency
- URL
## take-away : 
### 1. Single Responsibility Principle :
- The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".
- This should be kept in mind while designing and writing code, This leads to more understandable code and better code quality.

### 2. Extensibility : 
- It is a systemic measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the extension.
- For adding further extension the efforts should be as less as possible, and the code quality should also have been maintained.

### 3. Transparency :
- This is a metric which defines the code quality, the code quality depends on the readability of code and effective practices that are to be done while coding for a particular solution.
- Transparency gives the team of developer an edge while working and understanding the whole workflow of code.

### 4. URL :
- **URL** stands for _Uniform Resource Locator_. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. 
- The resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, JS code, an image etc. 
- The resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.
